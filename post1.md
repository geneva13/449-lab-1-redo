# Blog 1: Mansions of Mars

## 1/10/24

On this week's adventure, I went over to Mars to look at some top real estate!! I visted the small but mighty town of Martian Hallows, south of Great Martian City. I traveled down extraterrestrial lane, and my eyes were full of wonder gazing at the amazing architecture of these homes. The homes on this street are built with a space-age aesthetic, which comprises of layered dome shaped buildings making up the house. Each of the houses I saw were between 6,000 and 9,000 square feet. These homes date back to the early 1900s when President Xon moved to Great Martian City, and needed homes built to encourage rich buisnessman from other planets to move to mars and improve its economy.

"My house is so spacious each of my 11 space cats have their own room and walk-in closet of outfits!" says Yem Uefo, resident of the neighborhood who moved from Venus 10 years ago.
