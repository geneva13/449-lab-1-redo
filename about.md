# About Orbit Odyssey


My blog was created in 2024, with the goal of sharing my experiences across the galaxy. I am an intergallactic traveller, and I visit a new planet every week, interviewing the planet's residents and exploring ecosystems.  I am native to planet Earth.

For suggestions on what I should see next, Reach me at: 

ufowriter@earth.com 

Thanks!
