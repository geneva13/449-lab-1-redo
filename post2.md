# Vitimins in Venus
## 2/4/24
Hello fellow space enthusiasts, This week I went to Venus to learn more about the typical diet of Venus residents. After interviewing over 50 people, here are the most popular everyday dishes:


 Toast with Space Duck mayo, Gem Berries, Space Shnitzel, 
Purple Carrotts, Mega potato, Dinosaur Ribs, Roasted Cauliflower

"Here in Venus, we eat tons of vegetables, this is what makes us so radiant. Water is irrigated to every home, making farming vegetables the cheapest way to eat." -Venus Resident, 22

Now, this resident sure is right. Due to Venus' initial lack of water, World Leader Vop had his team of scientists come up with a way to make water out of sand. This method is so cheap that an irrigation system was implemented to every house. When walking in Venus, each house has a garden. I loved seeing this on my visit.
